Driven by deep learning advancements, speech synthesis has made significant strides in recent years. Existing technologies can produce human-like speech, enabling a wide range of applications.

However, the current state of speech synthesis lack fine-grained control over the generated speech. This limitation hinders the ability to create personalized and contextually relevant speech outputs, which are crucial for enhancing user experience in various applications.

In this article, we first review the current state of speech synthesis technologies, including their strengths and weaknesses. We then discuss the control mechanisms available in existing systems and their limitations. Finally, we envision the future of speech synthesis, highlighting the potential for more advanced control mechanisms and their implications for product development.
