## How to Become a Good Researcher?
A good researcher should be able to do the following: write a great [proposal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/), write a great [paper](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/), and give a great [talk](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/give-great-research-talk/).

In the awesome [talk](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/academic-program/write-great-research-paper/) from Simon Peyton Jones, we have learned several simple but effective tips to improve your writing.

```markdown
1. Don't wait until you've completed all experiments to start writing. 
2. A good idea is a reusable insight that's valuable to the reader. Even the most brilliant ideas are worthless if you don't share them.
3. Tell a clear story to present your “sharp” idea.
4. Nail your contributions to the whole paper.
5. Put related works later.
6. Put your readers first and use examples to present the main idea.
7. Listen to your readers.
8. Use the active voice and simple direct language.
```
