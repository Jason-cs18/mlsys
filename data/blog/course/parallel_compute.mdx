summary: 'fundamental principles of modern parallel computing systems'
---
Deep learning workloads are accelerated by modern parallel computing systems, which are designed to exploit the massive computational power of GPUs and other specialized hardware. In this section, we will discuss the fundamental principles of modern parallel computing systems and how they are used to accelerate deep learning workloads.
