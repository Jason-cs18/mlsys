PyTorch 2.x released `torch.compile` that accelerates the training and inference of PyTorch models. It is a compiler for PyTorch that automatically generates efficient models by optimizing the computation graph and applying various optimizations such as fusion, parallelization, and quantization.

In this post, we will dive into the details of `torch.compile` and explore how it can be used to accelerate the training and inference of PyTorch models.
