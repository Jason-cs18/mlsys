Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables large language models to ulize external knowledge sources to improve their performance. Compared with fine-tuning, it is a more cost-effective approach to inject new knowledge. However, building a reliable RAG system is challenging due to the complexity of compound AI systems and the expensive cost of long context inference.

In this post, we will dive into RAG and explore recent research advances.

## What is RAG?

## RAG vs. Fine-Tuning

## Main Challenges

## Recent Advances

## Open-source RAG engines

## Hands-on Tutorials

## Conclusion
