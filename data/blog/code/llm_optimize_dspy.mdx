Simply increasing model size is not feasible for many end-users due to expensive resource demands. A possible promising solution is to build a reliable compound AI system where LLM can reterieval external knowledge or call tools to complete tasks.

In this post, we will dive into the concept of compound AI systems and introduce some hands-on examples with DSPy.

## Why we need compound AI systems?
