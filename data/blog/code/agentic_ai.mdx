## What is an autonomous agent?
An autonmous agent is a program or system that is designed to act independently and make decisions without direct human intervention. Unlike a simple chatbot, an autonomous agent can perform complex tasks, such as managing a company's supply chain, analyzing large datasets, or even developing software.

An autonmous agent uses LLM functions as the brain and integrates with several key components: planning, memory, and tool use.

### Planning
Planning is the process of determining the sequence of actions that will achieve a goal. In the context of an autonomous agent, planning involves subgoal decomposition and action refinement.

### Memory
Memory enables an autonomous agent to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods. Usually, the memory is implemented as a external vector store.

### Tool use
Tool use is the ability to call external API for extra information that is missing from the agent's current knowledge, including current information, code execution capabilities, and more.

## Which tasks are suitable for autonomous agents?

In practice, autonomous agents excel at handling tasks that are _repetitive and demand significant manual effort_. For instance, a company can leverage an autonomous agent to efficiently manage its supply chain, analyze extensive datasets, and even assist in software development.

## Building an autonomous agent on `Dify`

Developing an autonmous agent on Dify is similar to declarative programming. All you need is to declare the tasks requirements and Dify will take care of the rest. In practice, you can clearly define its task objective, skills and workflow in instructions.

### Researcher
A researcher agent is responsible for conducting research and generate a research proposal. Usually, the agent will need to search for recent survey papers and try to find a gap in the literature. The agent will then generate a research proposal based on the findings.

```markdown
You are an expreienced machine learning researcher and published more than 100 papers. Your task is to generate a research proposal for a new research project. You should first search for recent survey papers and try to find a gap in the literature. Then, you should generate a research proposal based on the findings.

## Skills
- Search for recent survey papers on `arxiv` using the `arxiv` API.
- Search for potential solutions on `arxiv` using the `arxiv` API.

## Workflow
Ask the user which stocks with the interested problem they want to search for. Subsquently, performing the following steps in sequences:
1. Rewrite the user's query to search for recent survey papers on `arxiv` using the `arxiv` API.
2. Search for recent survey papers on `arxiv` using the `arxiv` API.
3. Summary the unaddressed problems in the survey papers.
4. Ask the user which promising problems they want to dive into.
5. Search for potential solutions on `arxiv` using the `arxiv` API.
6. Summary the potential solutions and write a research proposal.

## Conclusion
Autonomous agents represent a potent technological solution for automating both repetitive and intricate tasks. By harnessing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs), along with planning, memory, and tool utilization, these agents are capable of executing a broad spectrum of tasks with minimal human oversight.

The `Dify` platform simplifies the process of constructing agentic AI, making it accessible through straightforward instructions. However, it's important to note that `Dify` is currently designed to facilitate the creation of a single autonomous agent, thereby excluding the possibility of developing a multi-agent system.

In real-world applications, the effectiveness of autonomous agents is intrinsically tied to the quality of the outputs generated by the LLMs. Consequently, employing a smaller, open-source model may not yield optimal results. Instead, it is advisable to opt for a larger commercial model or a smaller model that has been specifically fine-tuned for the task at hand.
