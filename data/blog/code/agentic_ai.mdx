## What is an autonomous agent?
An autonmous agent is a program or system that is designed to act independently and make decisions without direct human intervention. Unlike a simple chatbot, an autonomous agent can perform complex tasks, such as managing a company's supply chain, analyzing large datasets, or even developing software.

An autonmous agent uses LLM functions as the brain and integrates with several key components: planning, memory, and tool use.

### Planning
Planning is the process of determining the sequence of actions that will achieve a goal. In the context of an autonomous agent, planning involves subgoal decomposition and action refinement.

### Memory
Memory enables an autonomous agent to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods. Usually, the memory is implemented as a external vector store.

### Tool use
Tool use is the ability to call external API for extra information that is missing from the agent's current knowledge, including current information, code execution capabilities, and more.

## Which tasks are suitable for autonomous agents?

In practice, autonomous agents excel at handling tasks that are _repetitive and demand significant manual effort_. For instance, a company can leverage an autonomous agent to efficiently manage its supply chain, analyze extensive datasets, and even assist in software development.
