summary: 'Making a fast and efficient ML model with GPU programming'
---
GPU and other AI accelerators make it possible to train and deploy large models quickly and efficiently. To deliever a fast and efficient ML model, we need to understand how it work on GPU and how to use GPU for optimizations.

In this post, we will dive into the basics of GPU programming and how it can be used to accelerate machine learning tasks.
