summary: 'Building a scalable AI platform for diverse AI workloads using Ray Cluster'
---
Deep learning has been demonstrated to be effective in solving a wide range of problems, from image and speech recognition to natural language processing and even playing complex games. However, deploying them in production can be challenging due to the complexity and resource requirements of deep learning models.

Usually, deploying a deep learning model involves several steps, including data preprocessing, model training, model evaluation, and model serving. Each step requires a different type of hardware and software, and the process can be time-consuming and error-prone.

In this post, we provide a step-by-step guide to building a scalable and unified AI platform using Ray Cluster. This platform enables you to scale different workloads within a single line of code, making it easier to deploy and manage deep learning models in production.
